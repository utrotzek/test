      0x01 - adhoc
  SSID            wireless SSID
      33-byte string containing SSID
  channel         
      single byte - not sure what values this takes or if it needs to be set
  region_id       wireless region id
      single byte - not sure what values this takes if it needs to be set
  keylen          WEP key length
      0x00 - 64-bit
      0x01 - 128-bit
  wep_key[0]      WEP key 0
      13-byte hex string containing key 0
  wep_key[1]      WEP key 1
      13-byte hex string containing key 1
  wep_key[2]      WEP key 2
      13-byte hex string containing key 2
  wep_key[3]      WEP key 3
      13-byte hex string containing key 3
  wepon           Is WEP enabled?
      0x00 - off
      0x01 - on
  wpa_cipher      Cipher used by WPA? AES/TKIP ??
      single byte - not sure what settings this takes
  wpa_mode        WPA mode

The user will choose the following settings:
   SSID

   Encryption
   WEP
       Enter key as string or hex
       Keylength - 64/128

       Key 3 (optional)
   WPA
       Cipher?
       PSK
   WPA2
       Cipher
       PSK

 Questions:
   - Does the channel need to be set, or is it detected automatically?
   - Does the region_id need to be set? If so, what values does it take?
   - What values does wpa_cipher take?
   - Need to let the user enter WEP key as a string?

Small change to test check-in process
